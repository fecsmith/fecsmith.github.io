description: On the subject of the game Twelve Minutes
---

Twelve Minutes is a game that I have been excited for since the initial trailer back at E3 2019. A mystery game played from an entirely top-down perspective where you replay a twelve minute time-loop is an intriguing premise. Whether it could live up to the promise is another question. I do love a good time loop; a couple of years before Twelve Minutes initial unveiling I had a fantastic time playing through a game whose devilishly clever gameplay is inversely proportional to the quality of its name: *The Sexy Brutale*.

The setup is simple: at the beginning of the initial loop you arrive home from work, you are greeted by your loving wife who has a special evening planned, which is quickly derailed when a policeman interrupts, ties you both up, and starts questioning your wife over the death of her father eight years prior. Before you can learn anything particularly meaningful, all of a sudden you are back at your front door, twelve minutes prior. From then on dying, being knocked unconscious, leaving the apartment or simply taking more than twelve minutes will send you careening back to this point. Solve for *x*.

While the setup is full of potential, mechanically the game is lacking a lot of what you would expect; the entire game takes place in three small rooms of the apartment which lead me to think there would be a large number of objects/interactions between things; puzzles to solve, secrets to uncover, etc. But that just isn’t the case. There are a handful of items total, each with no more than a couple of potential interactions, a decent amount of which have no actual purpose in the story anyway and half the ones that do can only be used at just the right time - the game doesn’t reward you for being clever and trying to jump ahead.

As a result there are a shockingly low number of actual puzzles to solve, in fact once I’d solved the first main conundrum it felt like the majority of the rest of the game was pretty much plain sailing. How much this is supposed to be considered a “puzzle game” vs a “narrative experience”, I’m not sure, but it certainly veers much more towards the latter than I’d expected.

If we are looking at this as more of a narrative experience, then the other thing to look at is the quality of the narrative, and it’s … it’s *something*. The game starts fantastically, and the majority of the game drip-feeds you information and disinformation which kept me going. The middle part of the game starts to fall foul of the one major pitfall of time-loop games: repetitiveness. There is obviously going to be some element of repetition in these titles, but even following the ideal path in Twelve Minutes sees you playing out multiple loops that are 80% the same content just to get a slightly updated piece of information at the end, to push you towards the ending; oh and how that ending arrives. Now at first I wasn’t unhappy with the ending as such; I was certainly willing to give it points for how *ballsy* it was. The issue is the story as presented at that point doesn’t actually stand up to any scrutiny at all. Then unfortunately the game carries on for about another twenty minutes from that point, which it spends dumping a bunch of dried out trope-based kindling underneath the entire thing and watching it all go up in a mess of flames.

By the end of the game, I felt nothing. I wasn’t happy, or sad, or glad it was over. It was just … a thing that I had done, and now I could uninstall it and move on to the next thing.

Ultimately my final verdict is skewed by the fact that Twelve Minutes was available at launch on Gamepass. I am a massive fan of Gamepass for PC; the number of games available for the amount I pay per month is great, so the fact that Twelve Minutes was “free” certainly helps soften the blow somewhat. The game retails at £19.49 according to Steam, and for that price I would have come away disappointed. I’m not one who subscribes to any kind of “£1 per hour or it’s not worth it” type of philosophy, but I played Twelve Minute for around four to five hours in total, and I think you’d have to be looking at something like a 75% off for me to still have come away feeling my aforementioned nothing.

So I guess that’s my verdict on Twelve Minutes: a score of “I would pay £4.88 for it”. Does that count as a score? Who cares - trying to put numbers against subjective opinion is dumb and leads to little beyond toxic discourse.
Either way; It didn’t come close to the lofty heights I had hoped for, but I had some fun amongst the frustration of playing it. If pushed, I’d just recommend playing [The Sexy Brutale](https://store.steampowered.com/app/552590/The_Sexy_Brutale/) instead.

The End.

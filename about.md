<p>Evening! I'm Sam, "fec" to some people that know me (long story), and I'm a DevOps Engineer by day.
By night too technically, since I don't change jobs in the middle of a day. Either way I'm just a DevOps
guy trying to make peoples lives easier, and do some cool stuff at the same time. I'm done QA, and a
Release Manager, but it's the fact that DevOps is a series of puzzles to solve that keeps me coming back.</p>

<p>When I'm not spending more time automating things than it would take to do them manually, I like to live
the stereotype of video games, board games, a cheeky bit of Warhammer, and listening to loud noises.</p>

<p>Got me a wife and a couple of kids, too. They're pretty awesome, though I am biased.</p>
